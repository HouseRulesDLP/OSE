# Orc
**AKA**: Bugbear, Euroz, Krork, Orteh<br/>
Orcs are a physically powerful race slightly taller than humans but much stockier and more muscled.  However, their naturally stooped posture makes them seem not much taller than the average human.  Their features are superficially similar to those of Goblins, causing some to believe that the species are related but neither Orcs nor Goblins consider this to be true.  Additionally, while both have similar skin tones, lack of hair and pointed ears, Orc teeth are less sharp with a pair of tusks protruding from their lower jaws.  The orcish lifespan is slightly less than that of a human, typically maturing around age 15 and living around 65 years.
