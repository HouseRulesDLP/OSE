Dwarves are a stocky fae species averaging around 4 to 5 feet in height, yet weighing as much as a full grown human.  Both men and women are capable of growing beards, though some choose to shave.  They typically mature at the same rate as humans, but are considered young until around the age of 50, as they typically live for 350 years.

### Dust of Ages
The age of the dwarf is long since past. A Dwarf’s Base and Max Fortune Points are reduced by 1 (to a minimum 1 **Max Fortune**).
### Enduring as Stone
Dwarves have endurance beyond that of humans.  They gain +1 HP per level.  Additionally, hit points rolled to heal a dwarf are rolled with *Advantage*.
### Fortitude of Iron
Dwarves have a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist poison and disease.
### Low-Light Vision
Dwarves see in dim light nearly as well as full daylight; however, this vision is shades of gray only, so color cannot be discerned in these conditions.  Also, this ability does not function in full darkness.
### True Name
As creatures of rock and stone, old as the earth, dwarves have True Names, and those with that knowledge may use a dwarf’s name against him. By calling out this name, a character gains *Advantage* on all actions taken against the dwarf, including attacks and saving throws.
