## Features
### Dust of Ages
The age of the dwarf is long since past. A Dwarf’s Base and Max Fortune Points are reduced by 1 (to a minimum 1 **Max Fortune**).
### Enduring as Stone
Dwarves have endurance beyond that of humans.  They gain +1 HP per level.  Additionally, hit points rolled to heal a dwarf are rolled with *Advantage*.
### Fortitude of Iron
Dwarves have a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist poison and disease.
### Low-Light Vision
Dwarves see in dim light nearly as well as full daylight; however, this vision is shades of gray only, so color cannot be discerned in these conditions.  Also, this ability does not function in full darkness.
### True Name
As creatures of rock and stone, old as the earth, dwarves have True Names, and those with that knowledge may use a dwarf’s name against him. By calling out this name, a character gains *Advantage* on all actions taken against the dwarf, including attacks and saving throws.
