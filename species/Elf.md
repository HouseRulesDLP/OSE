Elves are as much of the Fey world as they are of the mortal realm.  While this has granted them many advantages, such as a long life (typically living to be 750 years or more and not considered adults until after their first century has passed) and a greater capacity for resisting baleful magics, it also makes them seem among the most alien of all the common species.  They are slender in build and typically range between 5 and 6 feet in height.

### Autumn Folk
The age of the elves is long since past. A Elf’s Base and Max *Fortune Points* are reduced by 1 (to a minimum 1 *Max Fortune*).
### Elven Senses
Elves have +2 on Perception checks.
### Fae Blooded
Due to their inherently magical nature, elves gain a +2 bonus on all Saving Throws vs magic.
### True Name
As fae creatures, elves have True Names, and those with the knowledge may use an elf’s true name against her. By calling out the true name, a character gains *Advantage* on all actions taken against the elf, including attacks and saving throws.
