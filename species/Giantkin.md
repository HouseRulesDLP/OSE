Giantkin are believed to have the blood of true giants running in their veins.  There are many myths and legends for how this came about (typically involving some mad god or wizard trying to breed a mighty army), but regardless of their origin, they are a true species capable of having their own young.  They most often live in small communities on the outskirts of civilization, finding human-sized settlements and housing cramped and uncomfortable. The typical Giantkin stands between 7 and 8 feet in height and weights more than twice as much as the average human.  They mature at roughly the same rate as humans and a typical lifespan is somewhere around 80 years.

### Giant Strength
Giantkin calculate their encumbrance limits as if their Strength score were 4 points higher.

### Large
Giantkin treat two-handed weapons as if they were Versatile and Versatile weapons as if they were one-handed (while still gaining *Advantage* on damage rolls).  However, their large hands wield Light weapons with *Disadvantage* and any armor built for their size costs 4 times the normal amount.  Finally, they must eat 4 times as much as a human.
