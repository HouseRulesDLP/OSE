## Features
### Fey Blooded
Due to their inherently magical nature, goblins gain a +2 bonus on all Saving Throws vs magic.

### Low-Light Vision
Goblins see in dim light nearly as well as full daylight; however, this vision is shades of gray only, so color cannot be discerned in these conditions.  Also, this ability does not function in full darkness.

### Small Stature
Being small hurts in a fight. You are a small creature and have *Disadvantage* wielding any Heavy weapon, or when wielding a weapon with the Versatile property one-handed.

On the other hand, you gain a +2 bonus on all Stealth checks.

### True Name
As fae creatures, goblins have True Names, and those with the knowledge may use an goblinâ€™s true name against her. By calling out the true name, a character gains *Advantage* on all actions taken against the goblin, including attacks and saving throws.
