# Exhaustion
Exhaustion is a special condition representing a character’s endurance and being worn down by constant struggle and hardship.  Each time a character gains the [Fatigued](#fatigued) or [Exhausted](#exhausted) condition, they increase their rank of **Exhaustion** by 1.  Any time a character makes a [Task_Check](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md), their **Exhaustion Rank** acts as a negative modifier to the roll.  Additionally, at rank 1 Exhaustion, they subtract 5 feet from their base movement speed.  This increases to having their movement speed halved at rank 6 and reduced to 0 at rank 10.  If a character’s Exhaustion Rank would ever exceed 10, that character falls [unconscious](#unconscious), starts dying and must start rolling their [Death Pool](minimized_rules/Countdown_Pools.md#Death%20Pool).

After any highly strenuous activity (such as combat or sprinting) the participants must make a *Doom (CON)* save vs difficulty 12 or gain a level of **Exhaustion**.  If the activity lasts longer than 1 minute, this save must be made at the end of each minute (plus at the end of the activity) with a cumulative +3 difficulty penalty per extra minute (or fraction thereof).

*For example, a 15 round combat (1 minute 30 seconds) would require a difficulty 12 Fortitude save at the end of the 1st minute and then a difficulty 15 save at the end of the combat.*
