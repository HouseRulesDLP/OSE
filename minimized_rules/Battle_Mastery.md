# Battle Mastery
Fighters gain a new special ability called Battle Mastery.  Once per turn, as part of a normal melee attack, a fighter may declare a Battle Maneuver as part of their normal attack. This is a special move that won't do any extra damage, but can add additional consequences to the attack (such as tripping or disarming a foe). If the [Natural](CoreRules.md#Natural%20Roll) value of the attack roll is equal to or higher than the Battle Mastery target number, the move is successfully executed. Some maneuvers allow the defender to negate the effect with a successful saving throw (see the [below examples](#Basic%20Battle%20Maneuvers) for details).

Paladins and Rangers may also attempt Battle Maneuvers, but advance this ability at a slower pace due to focusing on matters beyond just battle.

Rogues, Clerics and their sub-classes advance with Battle Maneuvers slower still and may never attempt Advanced maneuvers.

Magic-Users and their sub-classes have the slowest advancement and may only ever attempt Basic maneuvers.

The following list of Battle Maneuvers is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, these are simply examples of would count as Basic, Intermediate and Advanced maneuvers.  Players are encouraged to come up with their own but the GM has final say on what rank a new maneuver has.

## Basic Battle Maneuvers:
### Blind
From throwing sand in someone's face, to pulling their cloak hood over their eyes to slashing their brow so they bleed into their own eyes, you attempt to impair your target's vision. The target makes _Ray (DEX) saving throw_. On a failure, the target becomes [Blinded](minimized_rules/Conditions.md#Blinded) until the _end_ of their next turn. This obviously has no effect on creatures that don't use their eyes to "see".

### Charge
Once per combat, a character may make a Charge maneuver into melee combat.  The character must move at least 20 ft. in a straight line to count as a charge before getting into melee range.  When they make their attack, they do so with a +2 bonus to hit, however, upon initiating this maneuver, the attacker gains a -2 penalty to their AC until the start of their next turn.

### Juke
You fake going one direction in order to slip past your foe by going the other way around.  The target must make a **Ray (DEX)** saving throw.  On a failure, the attacker may use their movement to move through the target's space and to exit their reach without risking a *Parting Shot* from the target.

### Shove
You force your opponent to move a few steps back.  The target must make a **Hold (STR)** save.  On a failure, they must step back 5 feet into an open space (either straight back, back-left or back-right; defender's choice) and the attacker may (if they so choose), step into the previously occupied space.  If there is no open space, the target loses their balance and attacks against them have [Advantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage) until the start of their next turn.  If the target is larger than the attacker, or has more than two legs, they make their save with *Advantage*.  If they are smaller, they have [Disadvantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage).
### Trip
You try to take your opponent's feet out from under them.  The target must make a **Hold (DEX)** save.  On a failure, they are knocked [Prone](Conditions.md#prone).  If the target is larger than the attacker, or has more than two legs, they make their save with [Advantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage).  If they are smaller, they have [Disadvantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage).  This has no effect on flying creatures or creatures without legs.

### Wrest
You attempt to grab an object currently in the possession of someone else.  An attack is made at -2 and, if successful, the attacker grabs hold of the object.  The attacker then must make a [Contested STR Check](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Contested%20Checks) for control of the object.  Whomever wins takes sole possession of the object.  In the event of a tie, both parties have a grip on the object and neither may use it and either party may attempt another STR vs STR contest as their main action on their subsequent turns.  Obviously, this maneuver requires at least 1 free hand to perform.

## Intermediate Battle Maneuvers
These are trickier maneuvers and add +3 to the Battle Master target number.

### Battle Cry
A roar, a shout, a stream of expletives; in some way you use voice and body language to try to unnerve your opponent. You must be able to speak to use this maneuver. The target must make a _Doom (WIS) saving throw_ or become [Frightened](minimized_rules/Conditions.md#Frightened) until the _end_ of their next turn. This has no effect on mindless creatures or beings otherwise immune to fear.

### Impair
Striking at your foe's arm or hand, you attempt to weaken their ability to strike.  The target makes a **Doom (CON)** saving throw.  On a failure, they suffer [Disadvantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage) on their next attack.  This cannot effect creatures immune to critical hits (such as undead and amorphous monsters).

### Martial Charge
This maneuver acts as the above [Charge](#Charge) maneuver with the following addition:

If the attacker's weapon has the *Lance* property, it rolls double the normal amount of damage dice on a hit.

**Note:** It is the weapon's properties causing the damage increase for this maneuver, not the maneuver itself.

### Rally
You let out a rallying cry, perform a flashy maneuver or otherwise attempt to embolden your allies.  Any ally within Near range who can see and hear you adds your **Charisma Modifier** (minimum +1) their next morale or fear-based saving throw during this combat.  Allies who already have broken morale or are [Frightened](Conditions.md#frightened) may immediately make a new save (adding your **CHA Mod**; min +1) to shake off the condition.

### Set
You brace yourself to receive an opponent's [Charge](#Charge).  If your weapon has the *Set* property you may use your reaction to make an attack against a charging foe.  If your attack hits, it will doubles its damage dice.
- [ ] ToDo: discuss set vs charge & weapon reach in the weapons document.

## Advanced Battle Maneuvers
These are the most difficult maneuvers and add +6 to the Battle Master target number.

### Disarm
You twist your target's weapon in such a way that they must pass a **Ray (DEX)** saving throw or it falls from their grasp.  Note that this only works on hand-held weapons, not natural weapons.  Weapons held in two hands make this save with [Advantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage).  If the save is failed, roll 1d10 to see where the target's weapon lands:

| d10 | Location                              |
| :-: | :------------------------------------ |
|  1  | At the defender's feet.               |
|  2  | At the attacker's feet.               |
|  3  | 5 feet behind the defender.           |
|  4  | 5 feet to the defender's left.        |
|  5  | 5 feet to the defender's right.       |
|  6  | 5 feet in front of the defender.      |
|  7  | 5 feet to the defender's rear-left.   |
|  8  | 5 feet to the defender's rear-right.  |
|  9  | 5 feet to the defender's front-left.  |
| 10  | 5 feet to the defender's front-right. |

### Sweep
You attempt to swing your weapon through multiple targets at the same time.  Pick 3 adjacent spaces within your melee reach.  A separate attack roll is made against each creature (friend or foe) within those spaces.  These attacks are all made at [Disadvantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage) to hit.  If hit, a target takes damage as normal.  Characters with the Minimum Damage ability do not benefit from that ability while using this maneuver.
