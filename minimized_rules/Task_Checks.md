# Task Checks
There are three broad types of **Task Check**: the [Ability Check](#Ability%20Check), the [Skilled Check](#Skilled%20Check) and the [Attack Roll](#Attack%20Roll).

## Ability Check
This is the most basic form of [Task Check](#Task%20Checks). The player simply rolls 1d20 and adds the appropriate *Ability Modifier* and compares the total to the [Difficulty](#Difficulty) set by the GM.
- Ability Checks involving Strength, Dexterity or Constitution are referred to as **Physical Checks**.
- Ability Checks involving Intelligence or Wisdom are referred to as **Mental Checks**.
- Ability Checks involving Charisma are referred to as **Social Checks**.

## Skilled Check
In some cases, a character may attempt a task that is directly related to their Class, Background or Culture. In these cases, an [Ability Check](#Ability%20Check) is made and the character adds the *Skill Bonus* to the check total. If a skilled check is called for, but the acting character lacks the skill, then (at the GMs discression) the skill roll may be attempted as a raw [Ability Check](#Ability%20Check) at [Disadvantage](Disadvantage).

Character skills are grouped into 2 broad categories: Class Skills and Secondary Skills.  A class skill is any check that can be directly related to the character's class (such as a Magic-User's knowledge of arcana, a priest's knowledge of religeon or a thief's skill at picking locks).  Secondary skills are those checks that directly relate to a character's Background or Culture (such as a Miner checking the stability of an underground tunnel or an Elf knowing the history of some lost elven kingdom).  The GM has final say on which skill bonus (if any) applies to the check.

Use the following chart to determine your character's Skill Bonus.


| Level | Class | Secondary |
| :---: | :---: | :-------: |
|   1   |  +1   |    +0     |
|   2   |  +1   |    +1     |
|   3   |  +2   |    +1     |
|   4   |  +3   |    +2     |
|   5   |  +3   |    +2     |
|   6   |  +4   |    +3     |
|   7   |  +5   |    +3     |
|   8   |  +5   |    +4     |
|   9   |  +6   |    +4     |
|  10   |  +7   |    +5     |
|  11   |  +7   |    +5     |
|  12   |  +8   |    +6     |
|  13   |  +9   |    +6     |
|  14   |  +9   |    +7     |
|  15   |  +10  |    +7     |

## Attack Roll
Whether swinging a sword, firing an arrow or simply punching someone in the face, an **Attack Roll** is required for the attacker to do damage to the target. Each class has an Attack Modifier that is added to the [Task Check](#Task%20Checks) along with the characters Strength or Dexterity modifier (depending on the type of attack). This must equal or exceed the target's *Armor Class* to be successful.

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>1d20 + Attack Bonus + {Strength or Dexterity} Modifier >= Armor Class</i></p>

## Difficulty
Any given [Task Check](#Task%20Checks) will be compared to a **Difficulty**. For attacks, this is typically the target's Armor Class. For other *Task Checks* ([Ability Checks](#Ability%20Check), [Skilled Checks](#Skilled%20Check) and [Saving Throws](#Saving%20Throw)), this will be a value determined by the GM based on how difficult the task is.

| Difficulty      | Target # |
|:---------------:|:--------:|
| Very Easy       | 6+       |
| Easy            | 9+       |
| Moderate        | 12+      |
| Tricky          | 15+      |
| Hard            | 18+      |
| Very Hard       | 21+      |
| Heroic          | 24+      |
| Legendary       | 27+      |
| Nigh Impossible | 30+      |

## Natural Roll
Occasionally, the rules will reference a **Natural Roll**. This is the die face that is showing after the roll, without applying any modifiers. *For example, if a warrior with a +3 attack bonus rolls a 12 on the die, their total result is 12+3 = 15. Their **Natural** result is just 12.*

## Automatic Success and Failure
It is not uncommon in d20 based systems to apply an **automatic success** and **automatic failure** rule for [Natural Rolls](#Natural%20Roll) of 20 and 1 (respectively). This system does not do that.

## Critical Results
There is no *Critical Failure* rule in this system.  The closest the system comes are the Spell Mishap rules.

Only [Attack Rolls](#Attack%20Roll) have a chance of **Critical Success**, which is defined as rolling a [Natural](#Natural%20Roll) 20 and exceeding (not meeting) the target's *AC*.

## Advantage and Disadvantage
**Advantage:** When rolling the dice, roll twice and take the *better* result.

**Disadvantage:** When rolling the dice, roll twice and take the *worse* result..

If a check has both **Advantage** and **Disadvantage** count up the number of each.  If there are more **Advantages**, the roll is made at **Advantage**.  If there are more **Disadvantages**, the roll is made at **Disadvantage**.  If they are equal, the roll is made normally.

## Contested Checks
When two or more individuals are directly opposing each other in a [Task Check](#Task%20Checks), a **Contested Check** may be made.  All parties involved roll their respective checks.  Whoever gets the highest check total is the winner.  If a tie results and does not make sense, re-roll.
