# Saving Throws
Saving throw categories have been renamed in order to make it clearer in which circumstance a save applies.

| Original                   | Renamed | Notes                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Death or Poison            | Doom    | Anything that can immediately kill or KO, bypassing hit points. |
| Wands                      | Ray     | Any beam-like effect that can potentially be dodged.            |
| Paralysis or Petrification | Hold    | Anything that can immobilize.                                   |
| Breath Weapon              | Blast   | Effects that physically target an area.                         |
| Spells, Rods or Staffs     | Spell   | Any magical effect not covered by the above.                    |
When determining which save category takes precedence, work your way down the chart in order, stopping at the first category that fits.
<p><i>
A poison needle that renders the victim unconscious would be a **Doom** save.<br/>
A dragon breathing a cone of fire would be a **Blast** save, but another exhaling a cloud of deadly poison would be a **Doom** save.<br/>
A spell that paralyzes would be a **Hold** save, while one that reads minds would be a **Spell** save.
</i></p>
Occasionally a saving throw may be modified by an ability.  When this is the case, the saving throw will be noted with the modifying ability.  For example, Ray (DEX) would denote a Ray saving throw modified by the character's Dexterity modifier.

## Automatic Success and Failure
A [Natural](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Natural%20Roll) 1 always results in a **failure** on a *Saving Throw* and a [Natural](Task_Checks.md#Natural%20Roll) 20 is always a success.
