# Glossary

## Ability Check
A [Task Check](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Task%20Checks) to which an *Ability Modifier* is added to the D20 roll.

## Advantage
See [Advantage and Disadvantage](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Advantage%20and%20Disadvantage).

## Caster Level
For Clerics, Druids, Illusionists and Magic-Users, this is equal to their [Character Level](#Character%20Level).  For other spellcasting classes (such as Paladins), this is generally equal to 1/3 or 2/3 their [Character Level](#Character%20Level).

## Concentration
This is the act of concentrating on a spell (or other activity that requires intense concentration).  Concentration may be lost by the character taking damage or other possible distractions.  See [Concentrating](Conditions.md#Concentrating) in the Conditions chapter.

## Concentration Check
A check to maintain [Concentration](Conditions.md#concentration).  Typically this takes the form of a Hold (WIS) Saving Throw.

## Condition
A state that (typically) negatively effects a given character.  See the [Conditions](Conditions.md) chapter.

## Contested Check
See [Contested Checks](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Contested%20Checks).
## Critical Hit
See [Critical Results](minimized_rules/Task_Checks.md#Critical%20Results).

## Damage Immunity
If a target is immune to the type of damage being done, it takes 0 damage.

## Damage Reduction
Damage is reduced by an amount equal to the Damage Reduction value (i.e. Damage Reduction (2) reduces damage by 2 points).  Damage cannot be reduced below 0 in this way.  Damage Reduction may be tagged with a damage type (fire, lightning, piercing, etc.), indicating that it only applies to damage of that type.

## Damage Resistance
If a target is resistant to the type of damage being done, it takes only half the damage (after modifiers; rounded down), but still takes a minimum of 1.

## Darkvision
Allows the creature to see in either dim light or full darkness.  Dim lighting is treated as bright light and is in full color.  Full darkness is treated as dim lighting and is only in shades of grey.  Does not work against magical darkness.

## Die Steps
Occasionally the rules call for a die type to be increased or reduced one or more steps.  Use the following table:

| Die | Method                                                                              |

| d12 |                                                                                     |
| d16 | Roll 1d4 and 1d8.  Take the d8 result and, if the d4 is 3+, add +8 to the total.    |
| d20 |                                                                                     |
