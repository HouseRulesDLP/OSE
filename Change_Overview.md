# Overview of Changes

- In addition to the usual selection of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20), you will also find references to the following:
    - **d2:** d4 divided by 2, rounded up
    - **d3:** d6 divided by 2, rounded up
    - **d5:** d10 divided by 2, rounded up
    - **d16:** Roll 1d4.  On a result of 1-2, roll 1d8+0; on a result of 3-4, roll 1d8+8
- "Races" are referred to by the more scientifically correct them "species".
    - Species are separate from classes.
- Prime Requisites do not affect XP gain.
- We will be using Backgrounds/Secondary Skills to further flesh out the characters.
- Hit Points above 0 represent minor wounds (scratches, bruises, sprains, etc), not serious injury.  
    - Once a character is reduced to 0 or fewer HP, the chance of a serious injury (including death) occurs.
- We are using the optional Ascending AC rules for OSE.
    - This, obviously, necessitates using the optional Attack Bonus rules rather than the attack matrices.
    - Further modifications have been made to smooth out the progression of the attack bonuses over the course of all of a classes levels.  The end result is a smoother transition from level to level while maintaining the same range of To Hit scores.
- Saving Throws have been modified to a stat-based saving throw system, replacing the arcane and confusing saving throw categories of old.
