# Overview of Changes

## Die Types
In addition to the usual selection of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20), you will also find references to the following:
- **d2:** d4 divided by 2, rounded up
- **d3:** d6 divided by 2, rounded up
- **d5:** d10 divided by 2, rounded up
- **d16:** Roll 1d4.  On a result of 1-2, roll 1d8+0; on a result of 3-4, roll 1d8+8
## Race/Species
"Races" are referred to by the more scientifically correct them "species".
- Species are separate from classes.
## Prime Requisits
Prime Requisites must still be satisfied to qualify for a class, but do not affect XP gain.
## Backgrounds/Secondary Skills
We will be using [Backgrounds](characters/Backgrounds.md)/Secondary Skills to further flesh out the characters.
## Competency
All characters will have a Competency score based on their class and level.  This value is used to determine a character's success when performing an action related to their class or background when there is both a chance of failure and a cost for that failure.
## Hit Points
Hit Points above 0 represent minor wounds (scratches, bruises, sprains, etc), not serious injury.  
- Once a character is reduced to 0 or fewer HP, the chance of a serious injury (including death) occurs.
## Ascending AC
We are using the optional Ascending AC rules for OSE.
- This, obviously, necessitates using the optional Attack Bonus rules rather than the attack matrices.
- Further modifications have been made to smooth out the progression of the attack bonuses over the course of all of a classes levels.  The end result is a smoother transition from level to level while maintaining the same range of To Hit scores.
## Saving Throws
Saving Throws have been modified to a stat-based saving throw system, replacing the arcane and confusing saving throw categories of old.
## Perception
All character's have a Perception score to notice ambushes, area traps (like pits, wolf/bear traps, tripwires, etc) and similar phenomena.  This is simply a [Competent](#competency) WIS check.
