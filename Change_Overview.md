# Overview of Changes

## Die Types
In addition to the usual selection of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20), you will also find references to the following:
- **d2:** d4 divided by 2, rounded up
- **d3:** d6 divided by 2, rounded up
- **d5:** d10 divided by 2, rounded up
- **d16:** Roll 1d4.  On a result of 1-2, roll 1d8+0; on a result of 3-4, roll 1d8+8

## Race/Species
"Races" are referred to by the more scientifically correct term "species".
- Species are separate from classes.
- Level limits and class restrictions are eliminated.
- See the [Species](species/Species.md) document for details.

## Prime Requisites
Prime Requisites must still be satisfied to qualify for a class, but do not affect XP gain.

## Backgrounds/Secondary Skills
We will be using [Backgrounds](characters/Backgrounds.md)/Secondary Skills to further flesh out the characters.  Background skill checks are rolled against the characters [General Skill](#General%20Skill) with a -2 modifier to the die roll.

## Skills
Many classes have class-specific skills (such as [Assassins](character_classes/Assassin.md), [Rangers](character_classes/Ranger.md), [Thieves](character_classes/Thief.md) and so forth).  These skills are rolled on a d20, with the goal being to roll equal or higher than the skill's value.  Additionally, an ability score modifier may be applied at the GM's discretion.

### Common Skills
All classes have 3 skills in common: Competency, Background and Perception.
- The **Competence** skill is used when a check would apply to a character's class.  Some specific uses of this skill may have static modifiers.  See your class's write-up for details.
- The **Background** skill applies if the character's [Background](characters/Backgrounds.md) can be logically be applied to the check being made.  Background checks are performed as Competency skill checks with a -2 penalty.  In the rare case that both a character's Background and Class would both apply, use the appropriate class skill (or Competency if no other applies) but roll with *Advantage*.
- The **Perception** skill is used to notice and search for things. Most classes roll this as a Competency skill check adjusted by the character's Wisdom modifier -1.

## Hit Points
Hit Points above 0 represent minor wounds (scratches, bruises, sprains, etc), not serious injury.  
- Once a character is reduced to 0 or fewer HP, the chance of a [[Serious Injury]] (and death) occurs.

## Ascending AC
We are using the optional Ascending AC rules for OSE.
- This, obviously, necessitates using the optional Attack Bonus rules rather than the attack matrices.
- Further modifications have been made to smooth out the progression of the attack bonuses over the course of all of a classes levels.  The end result is a smoother transition from level to level while maintaining the same range of To Hit scores.

## Saving Throws
Saving Throw categories have been renamed to make the situations in which each save applies a little more clear.

## Traits
An additional option to customize characters a bit further, Traits represent those abilities characters gain outside their chosen profession.  Each character gains their first Trait at level 2, and gains additional Traits at levels 6, 10 and 14.
