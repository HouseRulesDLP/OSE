# Ability Scores
In addition to the below modifications to the core rules for [ability scores](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Ability_Scores), your Ability Score modifier will be used in conjunction with performing class and background skill checks as well as saving throws.

## Ability Score Modifiers
All ability scores use the following ability modifiers table.  Ignore the existing separate tables for each ability in the core rules.

## Strength
- **Combat:** Your STR modifier applies to attacks with melee weapons, modifying both the to hit and damage rolls.  It may also be applied to thrown weapon attacks, if desired.
- **Saves:** Your STR modifier is used when making saves vs paralyzing effects and saves to resist being physically overpowered.
- **Other:** Any time you attempt a task requiring brute force (such as forcing open a stuck or barred door), apply your STR modifier.

## Intelligence
- **Languages:** Your INT modifier determines your number of starting languages.  You start play knowing 2 plus INT Modifier languages (minimum 1).  Typically this is at least your character's native language plus the "common" tongue of your starting region.  Other languages are purely a matter of personal choice.
- **Literacy:** Most Characters are not automatically literate with the exception of spellcasting classes (clerics, magic-users and their hybrids).  Other characters must gain literacy as either a background feature or by spending a single language pick on literacy.  Once literate, your character is considered literate in all languages they know.  A character with an INT mod if -3 or less can never become literate.
- **Spells:** Your INT modifier is the number of bonus 1st level arcane spells a magic-user can prepare.
- **Saves:** Your INT modifier applies to saving throws to see through illusions and other attempts at trickery.
- **Other:** Any task involving logic and knowledge uses your INT modifier.

## Wisdom
- **Spells:** Your WIS modifier is the number of bonus 1st level divine spells a cleric can prepare.
- **Saves:** Your WIS modifier is used for saving throws vs. charm and other willpower-based effects.
- **Perception:** Your WIS modifier is used on any perception check to notice hidden or otherwise inobvious details.
- **Other:** Any task involving willpower or spiritual fortitude uses your WIS modifier.

## Dexterity
- **Combat:** Your DEX modifier applies to ranged attacks, modifying both the to hit and damage rolls.  It may also be applied to melee attacks using weapons with the **finesse** property, if desired.
- **Saves:** Your DEX modifier applies to saves vs. effects that must be physically dodged and other reflex/evasion style effects.
- **Other:** Any check requiring quick reflexes, coordination, balance and other "agile" qualities uses your DEX modifier.

## Constitution
- **Hit Points:** Your CON modifier applies to your Hit Points at each level up to and including level 10.  If your CON Modifier changes after character creation, this HP change applies retroactively.
- **Saves:** Any saving throw involving endurance or physical fortitude (such as poisons and diseases) use your CON modifier.
- **Other:** Any other check relating to endurance or hardiness uses your CON modifier.

## Charisma
- **Number of Retainers:** Your CHA score is the maximum number of retainers your character may have.
- **Number of Allies:** Your CHA modifier is the maximum number of NPC allies your character may have (minimum 1).
- **Loyalty:** Your CHA modifier applies to the morale and other loyalty checks for your retainers and allies.
- **Reactions:** Your CHA modifier applies to NPC reaction rolls where your character is acting as the group spokesperson.
- **Saves:** Any saving throws involving your force of personality and sense of self (such as attempts to intimidate or otherwise manipulate your emotions) use your CHA modifier.
- **Other:** Any sort of social interaction will use your CHA modifier.

## Prime Requisite
Ignore the XP Modifier rule.

## A Note on Charisma and Wisdom
There will be many cases where Charisma and Wisdom overlap as "willpower", "force of personality" and "sense of self" are all very similar concepts.  How to differentiate these is largely left as an exercise for the GM, but one possible solution is to treat CHA as the "offensive" ability and WIS as "defensive".  Thus, if you want to intimidate someone, you would use CHA.  To resist being intimidated, however, would use WIS.
