# Creating a Character
Except as outlined below, character creation follows the Advanced Character Creation rules in OSE Advanced (pgs 18-19).

## Roll Ability Scores
We will be using the [BARFLIP](img/BARFLIP%20Worksheet.pdf) method.

## Choose a Species
Select one of the available species, keeping in mind the minimum ability score requirements for each species.  

The species listed in these rules do not have Ability Score Modifiers.

## Choose or Roll a Background Skill
Instead of using the Secondary Skills optional rule in OSE Advanced (pg 25), we will be using the [Background](characters/Backgrounds.md) house rules.

## Choose a Class
Select one of the available classes, keeping in mind the minimum ability score requirements for each class.

### Multiple Classes
These house rules contain the following pre-defined multi-class options: Cleric-Fighter, Cleric-Thief, Fighter-Magic-User, Fighter-Thief, Thief-Magic-User.

## Adjust Ability Scores
As per the core rules with the following exception:
- Only CHA may not be lowered.  Any other ability score is fair game.

## Note Ability Score Modifiers
See the [Ability Scores](characters/Ability_Scores.md) document for changes.

## Note Attack Bonus
Since we are using the Ascending AC optional rule, we will also be using the Attack Bonus optional rule.  As a result, ignore the rules on THACO and Attack Matrixes.

## Note Save Target and Class/Species Abilities
Class and Species abilities are defined in in the Species and [Classes](character_classes/Classes.md) documents.

Saving throws have been replaced with an ability-score based save system.  More can be read on that [here]().

### Weapon Proficiencies
Instead of the optional Weapon Proficiency rules on OSE Advanced (pg 23), weapons are grouped into the categories of Light, Medium and Heavy.  Different classes will be proficient in different combinations of these categories (for example, Fighters can use any but clerics may only use Light and Medium weapons).

## Record Starting Hit Points
Your starting HP are equal to the max of your class's Hit Dice plus your Constitution Modifier.

## No Alignment
This campaign will not be using alignment.  See the section on Passions instead.

## Note Known Languages
As per the core rules, but remember that alignment is not being used, thus there are no Alignment Languages.  See [Languages](Languages.md) for more details.

## Choose Starting Equipment
Your class and background determine your choices for starting equipment and money.  Starting equipment may be traded in for 1/2 it's value due to being worn-out hand-me-downs.

Any money you start with may be used in purchasing additional equipment.

## Note Armor Class
As given in the core rules.  Additionally, you should note the following on your character sheet:
- Your shield-less AC:  If your character is equipped with a shield, note their AC when the shield isn't being used.
- Your unarmored AC: Your character's unarmored AC is equal to 10 plus their DEX modifier.

## Note Level and XP
As per the core rules.
