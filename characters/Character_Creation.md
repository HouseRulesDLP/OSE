# Creating a Character

Except as outlined below, character creation follows the same steps and procedure as outlined in the [core rules](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Creating_a_Character).

## Roll Ability Scores
1. Roll 3d6 three times and note the values.  
2. Take each of these values and subtract them from 21 to get 3 more values.
3. Add up all 6 values to verify that your total equals 63.  If it does not, double-check your math from step 2.
4. Arrange these 6 values among your ability scores as desired (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA).

## Choose a Species
Select one of the available species, keeping in mind the minimum ability score requirements for each species.

## Choose or Roll a Background Skill
As per the OSE Advanced Fantasy rules.

## Choose a Class
Select one of the available classes, keeping in mind the minimum ability score requirements for each class.

## Adjust Ability Scores
As per the core rules with the following exception:
- Only CHA may not be lowered.  Any other ability score is fair game.

## Note Ability Score Modifiers
As per the core rules.

## Note Attack Bonus
This comes from your character class.

## Note Save Target and Class Abilities
These also come from your character class.  Other than the save target, this is largely the same as given in the core rules.

## Record Starting Hit Points
Your starting HP are equal to the max of your class's Hit Dice plus your Constitution Modifier.

## No Alignment
This campaign will not be using alignment.  See the section on Passions instead.

## Note Known Languages
As per the core rules, but remember that alignment is not being used, thus there are no Alignment Languages.

## Choose Starting Equipment
Your class and background determine your choices for starting equipment and money.  Starting equipment may be traded in for only 1/2 it's value due to being worn-out hand-me-downs.

Any money you start with may be used in purchasing additional equipment.

## Note Armor Class
As given in the core rules.  Additionally, you should note the following on your character sheet:
- Your shield-less AC:  If your character is equipped with a shield, note their AC when the shield isn't being used.
- Your unarmored AC: Your character's unarmored AC is equal to 10 plus their DEX modifier.
