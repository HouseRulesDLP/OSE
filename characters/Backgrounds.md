## Backgrounds (aka Secondary Skills)
The following rules expand on and override the Secondary Skills rules from OSE Advanced (pg 25).

### Background Career
Everyone did something before they became an adventurer. Roll (1d100) or select from the [Background Career Table](#background%20career%20table) to determine what it was your character did before being thrust into a life of adventure. This will determine some of your character's starting equipment.  Your character is automatically proficient with any weapon provided by their background occupation, but not the entire weapon group.

### Using Background Careers
If the character's Background can be logically be applied to the check being made.  Background checks are performed as Competence skill checks with a -2 penalty.  In the rare case that both a character's Background and Class would both apply, use the appropriate class skill (or Competence if no other applies) but roll with *Advantage*.

###### Background Career Table  
The column used for the roll should be chosen based on the culture in which your character was raised.
