## Languages
[Core rules](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Languages)

### The Common Tongue
What counts as "common" will depend on the campaign's starting region.  For example, countries in the Sheldomar Valley region will treat Keolandish as common.  On the other hand, countries in and around the Great Kingdom will treat Aerdi as the common language.

### Alignment Languages
There are no alignments, thus there are no alignment languages.

### Other Languages
The list given in the core rules is fine as far as it goes.  However, different species will also have their own regional dialects.  This means that, if separated by enough difference or time, two members of the same species may not be able to understand each other (such as the Dwarves of the Iron Hills vs the Dwarves of Ulleck).  

A list of local languages for your campaign's starting region should be supplied by your GM.

### Literacy
Most people in the world are either illiterate, or only semi-literate.  For Player Characters, this depends on Class, Background and (as a last resort) language picks.  Certain [Classes](character_classes/Classes.md) and [Backgrounds](characters/Backgrounds.md) automatically gain literacy.  If none of those apply, a PC may spend one of their [language picks](characters/Ability_Scores.md#Intelligence) to become literate.  Once literate, a character is considered literate in all languages they know.
