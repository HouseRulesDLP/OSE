# Core Rules

## Dice Notations
Throughout these rules there will be calls for die rolls noted in the following fashion: '#d#+#' (the 'd' may appear capitalized or lower case, it makes no difference).  The first number is the number of dice that will be rolled.  The second number is the size (maximum possible roll) of the die.  The last number is the modifier that is added to or subtracted from (or occasionally multiplied by or divided from) the roll.  *For example, 1d20 simply means to roll a single twenty-sided die with no modifiers.  4d6+2 is read as rolling four six-sided dice and adding 2 to the total.*

## D20 Check
The core mechanic of this system is the D20 Check. There are four broad types of D20 check: the Ability Check, the Skilled Check, the Attack Roll and the Saving Throw. An Ability Check is the roll of a 20-sided die, modified by the character's relevant Attribute Modifiers and then compared to a target difficulty. Skilled Checks and Attack Rolls can be consider sub-types of the Ability Check, which add in a character's Skill Ranks or Attack Bonus (respectively).

### Ability Check
This is the most basic form of [D20 Check](#D20%20Check). The player simply rolls 1d20 and adds the appropriate Ability Modifier and compares the total to the Difficulty set by the GM.
- Ability Checks involving Strength, Dexterity or Constitution are referred to as *Physical Checks*.
- Ability Checks involving Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma are referred to as *Mental Checks*.

### Skilled Check
In some cases, a character may attempt a task that is directly related to one of their Skills. In these cases, an [Ability Check](#Ability%20Check) is made and the character adds their Skill Bonus to the check total. Rogues and hybrid-rogues gain more skills than other classes. If a skilled check is called for, but the acting character lacks the skill, then the skill roll is made as a raw Ability Check at Disadvantage, if the GM rules that the check is possible at all.

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>1d20 + Ability Modifier + Skill Bonus >= Difficulty</i></p>

### Attack Roll
Whether swinging a sword, firing an arrow or simply punching someone in the face, an **Attack Roll** is required for the attacker to do damage to the target. Each class has an Attack Modifier that is added to the [D20 Roll](#The%20D20%20Check) along with the characters Strength or Dexterity modifier (depending on the type of attack). This must equal or exceed the target's Armor Class to be successful.

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>1d20 + Attack Bonus + {Strength or Dexterity} Modifier >= Armor Class</i></p>

### Saving Throw
**Saving Throws** are a specialized type of [D20 Check](#D20%20Check). Each Class has a set of Saving Throw Modifiers that are applied to the d20 roll along with an appropriate Ability Modifier.

Unlike other [D20 Checks](#D20%20Check), a [Natural](#Natural%20Roll) 1 always results in a failure on a **Saving Throw** and a [Natural](#Natural%20Roll) 20 is always a success.

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>1d20 + Saving Throw Modifier + Ability Modifier >= Difficulty</i></p>

### Difficulty
Any given [D20 Check](#D20%20Check) will be compared to a **Difficulty**. For attacks, this is typically the target's Armor Class. For other *D20 Checks* ([Ability Checks](#Ability%20Check), [Skilled Checks](#Skilled%20Check) and [Saving Throws](#Saving%20Throw)), this will be a value determined by the GM based on how difficult the task is.

| Difficulty      | Target # |
|:---------------:|:--------:|
| Very Easy       | 6+       |
| Easy            | 9+       |
| Moderate        | 12+      |
| Tricky          | 15+      |
| Hard            | 18+      |
| Very Hard       | 21+      |
| Heroic          | 24+      |
| Legendary       | 27+      |
| Nigh Impossible | 30+      |

### Natural Roll
Occasionally, the rules will reference a **Natural Roll**. This is the die face that is showing after the roll, without applying any modifiers. *For example, if a warrior with a +3 attack bonus rolls a 12 on the die, their total result is 12+3 = 15. Their **Natural** result is just 12.*

### Automatic Success and Failure
It is not uncommon in d20 based systems to apply an **automatic success** and **automatic failure** rule for [Natural Rolls](#Natural%20Roll) of 20 and 1 (respectively). This system does not do that with the exception of [Saving Throws](#Saving%20Throw).

### Critical Results
There is no *Critical Failure* rule in this system.  The closest the system comes are the Spell Mishap rules.

Only [Attack Rolls](#Attack%20Roll) have a chance of **Critical Success**, which is defined as rolling a [Natural](#Natural%20Roll) 20 and exceeding (not meeting) the target's *AC*.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
**Advantage:** When rolling the dice, roll twice and take the *better* result.

**Disadvantage:** When rolling the dice, roll twice and take the *worse* result..

If a check has both **Advantage** and **Disadvantage** count up the number of each.  If there are more **Advantages**, the roll is made at **Advantage**.  If there are more **Disadvantages**, the roll is made at **Disadvantage**.  If they are equal, the roll is made normally.
